This proof of concept tries to demostrate that exists an error during formatters registration in a Spring 4.3.3 application using Spring Boot if some `@Configuration` class extends the `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` abstract class.

For more details, see https://github.com/jcagarcia/proofs/tree/master/spring-security-and-formatters[spring-security-and-formatters]
